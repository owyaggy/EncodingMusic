    "    * Audio feature data is stored in a dictionary for each track\n",
    "    * The difference between the values for each feature is computed\n",
    "        * So, a small number for `valence` indicates 2 tracks have very similar valence, while a large number indicates very different valence\n",
    "        * For scalar features (those measured from 1-0), this is a simple process\n",
    "        * Some features just need to be translated to a different scale (e.g. `loudness` can be transposed from a -60 to 0 scale to a 0 to 1 scale) (see the code for step-by-step comments)\n",
    "        * For comparing keys, a more complicated algorithm is needed to account for similar keys (see `compare_keys(...)`)\n",
    "    * The output is a dictionary where each entry is measures how similar a feature is, for example `'valence': 0.03` indicates similar valence\n",
    "\n",
    "##### An important note\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing two songs, audio features play differently sized roles in determining how similar they sound. Our code accounts for this by allowing the weight of each audio feature to be selected. We also set default values to account for the usefulness of some of the audio feature comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, loudness is measured on a logarithmic scale. Comparisons on this scale aren't very useful, and loudness as a feature is somewhat arbitrary because the same recording could be mixed with a higher or lower decibel level. By default, we ignore loudness, setting its weight to 0, when we compare playlists. However, we leave the code intact, both for future modification and in case the user decides a comparison of loudness could be useful. We also give mode very little weight, for example, because whether a track is in a major or minor key is likely an insignificant factor in determining similarity. In recognition of the subjective nature of these weights, we allow the user to select the weights they would like to use through sliders. This is discussed later.\n",
