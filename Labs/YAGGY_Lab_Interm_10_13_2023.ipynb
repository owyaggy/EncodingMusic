    "# THE BIG ONE #\n",
    "\n",
    "This is work towards my SpotiPy project.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we ultimately aim to relate people, this code ultimately outputs a scalar telling you how similar 2 songs are.\n",
    "The main function is `similarity_scalar(...)`:\n",
    " `similarity_scalar(song_id_1, song_id_2, playlist_dataframe)`\n",
    " \n",
    "To explain how the value is computed, I can walk through the code:\n",
    "1. First, in `similarity_dict(...)`:\n",
    "    * Audio feature data is stored in a dictionary for each track\n",
    "    * The difference between the values for each feature is computed\n",
    "        * So, a small number for `valence` indicates 2 tracks have very similar valence, while a large number indicates very different valence\n",
    "        * For scalar features (those measured from 1-0), this is a simple process\n",
    "        * Some features just need to be translated to a different scale (e.g. `loudness` can be transposed from a -60 to 0 scale to a 0 to 1 scale)\n",
    "        * For comparing keys, a more complicated algorithm is needed to account for similar keys (see `compare_keys(...)`)\n",
    "    * The output is a dictionary where each entry is measures how similar a feature is, for example `'valence': 0.03` indicates similar valence\n",
    "2. Then, in `similarity_scalar_from_dict(...)`:\n",
    "    * The dictionary resulting from `similarity_dict(...)` is taken as an input\n",
    "    * Every difference between similarities is summed\n",
    "    * This number is divided by the total number of audio features (we use 9)\n",
    "    * The result is a number between 0-1, where 0 represents identical, and 1 represents completely different\n",
    "    * However, we want 1 to represent identical, and 0 to represent completely different, so we invert this scale (subtracting the number we got before from 1)\n",
    "3. Finally, in `similarity_scalar(...)`:\n",
    "    * This function is the exact same as `similarity_scalar_from_dict(...)`, it just takes song IDs and the playlist dataframe as inputs\n",
    "    * This means you only need to use one function to get the data you want\n",
    "    * It inputs the parameters into `similarity_dict(...)` and `similarity_scalar_from_dict(...)`, and returns the result\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `similarity_scalar_from_dict(...)` and `similarity_scalar(...)` have one more important characteristic:\n",
    "\n",
    "### AUDIO FEATURE WEIGHTING ###\n",
    "\n",
    "For various reasons, we might decide that not all every Spotify audio feature should be weighted equally when comparing tracks. For example, is `instrumentalness` really as important as `valence`?\n",
    "\n",
    "While the `similarity_scalar` methods by default treat all audio features equally, you can use optional parameters to customize the weighting of each audio feature. The default weight is 1. So if you wanted to prioritize `valence`, and de-emphasize `mode`, you could write:\n",
    "`similarity_scalar(song_id_1, song_id_2, playlist_dataframe, valence=3, mode=0)`\n",
    "This would weight valence 3 times as much as every other audio feature. This can be a float, like 0.5, or even 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this is somewhat unclean, because it uses error handling. Partially because I wanted to experiment with it, this method uses **kwargs. The code assumes the user has given a custom parameter for every audio feature, and handles the KeyError that occurs whenever they haven't. It works by multiplying the similarity difference for a feature by its weight before adding it to the total similarity difference for 2 tracks. The resulting sum is then divided by the sum of all the weights combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The better way to do this would be to include an optional, default parameter in the method definition for each possible audio feature. This is better because it eliminates the need for error handling, and, makes it possible to set type hints for weights, and gives more useful errors (if you try to set an audio feature that doesn't exist, you'll get an error, and if you set it to an invalid value, you'll know more easily).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps ####\n",
    "The natural next step is writing a function to compare all the songs in a playlist to each other. However, since this increases the amount of data crunching by an order of magnitude, I am curious (if not concerned) about how long this might take, especially since our initial plan is comparing every song to each other in order to relate people. With 72 playlists * 10 songs = 720 songs, that's (720(720 + 1))/2 = 259,560 song comparisons, each of which has at least O(n^2) runtime. I'm curious how long that might take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each playlist is a dataframe, we would also need to create a dataframe containing each playlist dataframe."
